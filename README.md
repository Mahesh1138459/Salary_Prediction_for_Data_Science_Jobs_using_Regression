# Salary Prediction for Data Science Jobs using Regression Algorithms

###

Objective of this project is to predict Data Science Salaries. We have to analyse the historical data and based on that find insights and make predictions effectively.

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn.

## Appendix
